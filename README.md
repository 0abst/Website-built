# WebsitePeer2Panel

With Gatsby, I created the following website:

https://peer2panel-com-website.vercel.app/

The aim is to have a platform for showing a prototype of a solar panel which automatically stores measurements on its performance on the blockchain. The aim with this prototype is to make sure a bridge between real world assets (in this case the solar panel) and the digital world can be done.
