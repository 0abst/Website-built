# Website built with Gatsby

With Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), I created the following website:

https://peer2panel-com-website.vercel.app/

The aim is to have a platform for showing a prototype of a solar panel which automatically stores measurements on its performance on the blockchain. 

This website has been done as a follow-up of the Swiss Blockchain hackhaton
